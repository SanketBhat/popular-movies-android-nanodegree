# Popular Movies
This is second project in the Android Developer Nanodegree, Udacity. I created it from scratch.

## What does it do?
- Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails
- UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated
- Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis
- When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly

## Libraries and APIs used
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)
- [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)

## Before you build
  This project uses `TheMovieDB API` to fetch the movie name and details. Before you build the project add your `API KEY` to the `gradle.properties` file
